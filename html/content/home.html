<div class="header4">Who I Am</div>
<div>
    I'm Will Hauber, a third year student in the 2018 class at the University of Cincinnati. I will be majoring in Computer Science through CEAS as well as earning an MBA through the ACCEND program and the Lindner College of Business. 
    Computers are something that fascinate me greatly, and learning how to program them is one of my favorite activities. My interest in coding began a number of years ago, when I discovered a program called Game Maker. True to its name, 
    it is a integrated development environment specializing in creating video games. I downloaded the program right after dinner and was still programming in it the next morning. Ever since then, computer programming and PC games have 
    been a significant part of my life. I've managed to write a few programs since then, including a couple games, parts of a web crawler, and an encryption program.  My dream career is to own and develop in my own video game company.

<div class="header4">What I Love</div>
<div>
    I also love the outdoors. I've been involved with the Scouting program for quite some time, and have developed a great interest backpacking, rock climbing, and camping as a result. In fact, during the past three summers I worked at 
    a BSA camp as a Climbing Tower Instructor, which only magnified my passion for the sport. I also attended the week-long NYLT - national youth leadership training - which continues to influence my decisions and attitudes toward 
    leadership and teamwork. I've also been backpacking through the Rockies, swimming in the Grand Canyon, white water rafting on the Youghiogheny River, and climbing at Red River Gorge.  All of my experiences in Scouting converged in 
    February of 2013, when I earned my Eagle Scout rank, the highest rank in BSA.

<div class="header4">Where I'm Going</div>
<div>
    Clearly though, I have many more experiences to create, enjoy, and learn from, and I'm eager to see what lies ahead of me. Hopefully my time at UC and in the honors program will provide the intellectually and philosophically stimulating 
    environment that I believe it will. I'll continue to post updates as my experiences and outlooks on life change and grow.
